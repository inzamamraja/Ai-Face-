AI Face Detector

Overview

AI Face Detector is a web-based face shape and symmetry analysis tool designed for real-time detection using TensorFlow.js and MediaPipe FaceMesh. The application runs entirely on your Android device, allowing users to analyze face shape, symmetry, and key facial landmarks in real time or through image uploads.

Features

Real-Time Face Detection – Uses your camera to detect facial landmarks instantly.

Face Shape Classification – Determines whether your face is oval, round, square, heart, or other shapes.

Facial Symmetry Analysis – Provides insights into facial proportions and balance.

Image Upload Support – Allows users to analyze photos instead of using live input.

Advanced Visualization – Displays facial landmarks, symmetry lines, and overlays for better analysis.

Mobile Optimized – Runs smoothly on Android browsers without requiring installation.

Privacy-Focused – Works locally in your browser, ensuring no images are stored or uploaded to a server.


How It Works

1. Open the App – Launch the AI Face Detector in your mobile browser.


2. Choose Detection Mode – Use the live camera or upload an image.


3. Analyze Your Face – The AI detects key facial features and provides insights.


4. View Results – Get real-time feedback on your face shape and symmetry.



Technology Stack

TensorFlow.js – Machine learning for face detection.

MediaPipe FaceMesh – Extracts precise facial landmarks.

JavaScript, HTML, CSS – Optimized for web-based execution.


Installation (PWA)

1. Open the AI Face Detector in your browser.


2. Tap the Install button (or "Add to Home Screen" option in Chrome).


3. Launch it anytime like a native app.



Future Enhancements

More Face Shapes – Support for additional classifications.

3D Face Analysis – Advanced depth-based symmetry detection.

Customization – Adjustable overlays and interactive UI.


This project is built for high accuracy, zero errors, and seamless mobile experience.
